## Introduction
In this project, we aimed to develop a stroke prediction model using machine learning techniques. Stroke is a serious medical condition that requires prompt treatment, and developing an accurate prediction model can aid in early detection and intervention.

## Dataset
We utilized the Stroke Prediction Dataset, which contains various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle features of individuals along with their stroke status. The dataset includes attributes such as age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), etc.

## Data Preprocessing
Before building the prediction model, we performed thorough data preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted extensive EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Some key observations from EDA include:
- Distribution of stroke cases among different age groups
- Correlation analysis between features and stroke occurrence
- Visualization of stroke risk factors

## Model Building
We experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms to build the prediction model, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

## Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the models, we employed various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we used techniques like cross-validation and ROC curve analysis to assess model robustness and generalization.

## Results
After rigorous analysis and evaluation, we achieved promising results with our prediction model. The model demonstrated high accuracy and reliable performance in identifying individuals at risk of stroke.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting strokes based on demographic and clinical factors. Early detection facilitated by such models can potentially save lives by enabling timely medical intervention.
